# Financial-Compliance-and-Predictive-Anomaly-Detection

This project presents a dual layer financial monitoring pipeline that combines traditional regulatory compliance rules with unsupervised machine learning to detect complex fraud and money laundering patterns. The system begins with a robust data engineering workflow that sanitizes raw transaction logs, utilizing automated encoding detection to convert diverse file formats into a unified UTF-8 standard and merging them with customer master data to provide critical account status context.

In the first analytical layer, compliance filters identify immediate regulatory risks. This rule based approach flagged a high risk $15000 transaction linked to a dormant account and uncovered a structuring pattern where a client moved $19300 through small, coordinated transfers to bypass standard reporting thresholds. To capture risks that evade these rules, the pipeline's second layer employs K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct behavioral peer groups, establishing baselines for normal activity based on volume and frequency. Building on this segmentation, an Isolation Forest model acts as the final anomaly detection mechanism, successfully isolating a statistically $500 transaction that traditional filters ignored. Ultimately, this hybrid methodology enhances audit efficiency by providing deep behavioral context, reducing false positives, and identifying sophisticated financial threats.
